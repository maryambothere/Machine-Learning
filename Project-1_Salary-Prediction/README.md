# Salary Prediction using Linear Regression

## Project Overview
This project implements **Simple Linear Regression** to predict employee salaries based on years of experience.  
The goal is to understand the relationship between experience and salary and to practice building and evaluating regression models.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains two columns:
  - `YearsExperience` – Number of years an employee has worked
  - `Salary` – Employee salary in USD
- Source: **Kaggle**

## Steps
1. **Data Exploration:** Visualizing data to understand trends and relationships.
2. **Model Building:** Training a simple linear regression model using Python.
3. **Evaluation:** Evaluating the model using metrics:
   - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - R² Score
4. **Prediction:** Using the trained model to predict salaries for new values of experience.

## Key Insights
- The dataset shows a strong linear relationship between experience and salary.
- The trained model achieved:
  - RMSE: 7492.50
  - R²: 0.8887
- This indicates that the model explains about 88.9% of the variation in salaries.
